# .NET Core Essentials for Web Development

Length: 2 days
Delivered as in-person or virtual training

In the past, development with .NET and C# was reserved just for those who wanted to commit themselves to Windows and Visual Studio.  With the rise of .NET Core, the paradigm is shifting to allow developers on all platforms to build scalable and powerful services.

This course is designed to take students unfamilar with .NET Core on a journey through the building their first web application on this new platform.

Students will learn about the latest changes to the .NET ecosystem, how to build their first ASP.NET Core application that can target Windows, Linux, Mac, and Docker, and learn about the essential tools inside ASP.NET Core that’ll allow them to build next generation web applications.
